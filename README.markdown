# A pandoc template for the UCB letter head

Adapted from [Berkeley 2020 Letterhead 4 color formal version - Overleaf, Online LaTeX Editor](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/berkeley-2020-letterhead-4-color-formal-version/ryrsfvdsztpq).

# Usage

Follow the example in `main.md` to see how to write the cover letter. Then run

```sh
pandoc -s -o main.pdf main.md --template=ucb-letterhead.latex --pdf-engine=lualatex
```

Note that for best results, use a matching pandoc version with the template provided here. See the first line of the template `ucb-letterhead.latex` for the pandoc version it supports.

## Advanced Usage

The template here is generated by a script. For a different pandoc version, you can generate it as follows:

```sh
util/generate_pandoc_template.py > ucb-letterhead.latex
```

Or using make,

```sh
# generate a new template
make template -B
# see the difference made to the default template
make diff DIFF=YOUR_FAVORITE_DIFF_PROGRAM
# such as
make diff DIFF=diff
```
